Project Description:
The objective of this is to show how that we can get from the data sources to the Data warehouse. 
The ETL process is done using SQL language, but some tools like Azure Data Factory could be effeciently used.

The source database schema (northwind operationnal database) and the Star Schema (Datamart) are also added in the repo.

The work described here is based on https://github.com/anasmorahhib/Northwind-datawarehouse
